                <h2 class="font-script final-title">To the most extraordinary woman I have ever met</h2>
                <p class="final-text">
                    I do not even know where to start. But as I promise, I will try my best, because someone that outstanding like you deserves to know this.
                </p>

                <p class="final-text">
                    You are not "just amazing", you are the most rarest kind of woman I ever met. A Goddess wrapped in sarcasm, intelligence, love and beauty. You are like a sunrise to me everymorning, 
                    when I text you and sent you photo of Foxie, my day starts automatically gonna be better.
                </p>

                <p class="final-text">
                    I know, that you are a strong woman, how you can handle yourself, your migraines, anxiety and everything. But PLEASE do not leave all this just for yourself. I really want to get to know you
                    and help you with everything if I can. Call me anytime even at 4AM, wake me up and told me "Hello dumbass, Your Godess want to talk with you" and I will be imidiately awake.
                </p>

                <p class="final-text">
                    You made me laugh, reflect, think differently and hotestly be beter person. I love your dinnosaur obsession, your high expectations (Like you said, they are so high, they need visa to get back to Earth).
                    I see how deeply you feel things and I love that about you, how much emphaty you have inside you.
                </p>

                <p class="final-text">
                    I read messages from you more than once, not beacuse I did not get it first time, BUT because I wanted to. Because every message, word, feeling (event deleted massages which make me still angry but I understand that),
                    it matter for me. You matter to me, more than you know.
                </p>

                <p class="final-text">
                    You said me yesterday (29.05.2025) that people do not listen the first time. SO LET ME BE VERY CLEAR WITH THIS - I HEARD YOU!. I see all the little thing you expect from me. For example capital letters, names.
                    And you are THE GIRL who deserves more than just "okay i guess", which I really mess up yesterday (29.05.2025) and I am sorry for that. I am still feeling bad about that.
                </p>

                <p class="final-text">
                    You are not too much, not dramatic, not difficult or challenging. You are Lucy the most gorgeous woman who deserves patience, softness, consistency and someone (ME) who actually pays attention to you and your needs.
                </p>

                <p class="final-text">
                    And I am not perfect, I know that. But I am here. I care. And I am learning from you, for you and with you.
                </p>

                <p class="final-text">
                    Thank you for you. For sharing all pieces from your world with me. I know, that you are a busy woman who deserves all what she want!
                </p>

                <p class="final-text">
                    With all the respect (and probably too much admiration), I will be always here for you. And yes, I am getting obsessed with you
                </p>

                <p class="final-text">
                    P.S.: Our date to the cinema (04.07.2025) is still a real deal that is valid.
