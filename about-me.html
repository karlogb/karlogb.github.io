        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I became interested in digital marketing in high school, where I started learning about it. In my senior year, we had a lecture on online marketing at school, and I knew this was something I wanted to do in my life.</p>
        <p>Two months later, I got a job at a digital advertising agency. This is where I learned the basics of online marketing. I knew right away that this is what I enjoy and I want to get better at it. That is why I am self-educing myself in this area for almost 5 years. The agency has helped me in my personal development. I learned to work in a team, got better at communication, and learned to keep to the deadline. During my time at the agency, I also had several workshops for my colleagues and the agency's clients. They were mainly related to Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager</p>
        <p>Over time, I have also become interested in programming, which I devote my spare time to simplifying work. I currently work at an advertising agency and have several projects outside the agency for personal growth.</p>
