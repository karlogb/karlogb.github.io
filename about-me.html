    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
        Hey, I'm Karol – a passionate developer, data engineer, and digital creator who believes that smart code can change how we live, work, and even entertain ourselves.
        I specialize in turning complex problems into simple, scalable, and often automated solutions. Whether it's a data pipeline, a dashboard, or a horror story narrated by AI – I’m all about bringing ideas to life through tech.
    </p>
    <p>
        My expertise lies in Python scripting, web and data analytics, cloud infrastructure (Google Cloud, AWS), and API integrations. I’ve spent years building systems that make data flow smoother, insights clearer, and businesses smarter. From writing automation scripts that eliminate hours of manual work, to designing full-stack data platforms using BigQuery, Power BI, and Looker Studio – I live for efficiency and innovation.
    </p>
    <p>
        I thrive in that sweet spot where development meets creativity. That’s why I founded <strong>Strach Z Temnoty</strong> – a brand focused on AI-generated horror content. Using tools like OpenAI, ElevenLabs, and MoviePy, I create spine-chilling short-form videos for TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube. It’s where machine learning meets storytelling – and the results are surprisingly human (and terrifying).
    </p>
    <p>
        I enjoy bridging the gap between technical complexity and human experience. Whether I’m building dashboards for data teams or producing creepy content that triggers goosebumps, I always aim to leave an impact. I believe in using technology not just to automate and analyze – but to inspire, engage, and even entertain.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you're into building cool things, solving hard problems, or exploring how AI can tell better stories – we're already on the same wavelength. Let's connect, collaborate, and create something awesome (or scary).
