        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Over the years, I've worked on designing and implementing data solutions that help businesses make informed decisions and optimize their processes.</p>
        <p>I specialize in working with large-scale data processing, building efficient data models, and optimizing database systems. I'm always eager to explore new technologies and stay ahead of trends in data engineering and analytics to create innovative solutions for complex challenges.</p>
        <p>Throughout my career, I’ve collaborated with diverse teams to develop and maintain data platforms that power analytics and reporting needs. Beyond the technical side, I enjoy bridging the gap between data and business, making complex data concepts accessible to non-technical stakeholders.</p>
        <p>I believe that well-structured data can drive real impact, and I’m always looking for new challenges where I can contribute my skills</p>
